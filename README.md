# deepLearning_faceRecognition

- **Files**:
  - There are several files here. Some are older versions of the same idea. 
  - The newest one is final2.
  - There is a script to use a webapp/local app to open a webcam and do emotion detection on your face. That is the script called: web_app_face

- **Project Objective**:
  - The project aims to develop a deep-learning model for facial emotion detection using the VGG16 architecture. Its objective is to accurately classify facial expressions into predefined emotion categories.

- **Dataset Description**:
  - The dataset consists of facial images labelled with emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc.

- **Model Architecture**:
  - The deep learning model architecture is based on VGG16, a convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

- **Results and Insights**:
  - The model achieves competitive performance on both training and validation datasets, with high accuracy and balanced precision and recall.

- **Role in the Project**:
  - My role in the project involved developing and implementing the machine learning model, including selecting the architecture, preprocessing data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
